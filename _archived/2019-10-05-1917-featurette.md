[Take a moment to watch this behind the scenes for the upcoming WW1 film "1917". ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys_BZXi02yQ) It's shot to be presented as a single continuous shot for the entire runtime. This movie looks absolutely incredible and I'm excited to see it when it comes out in January.
