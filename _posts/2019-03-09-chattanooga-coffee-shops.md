Here are some of my favorite Chattanoogan coffee shops, in no particular order.

**[Goodman Coffee Roasters](https://www.goodmancoffeeroasters.com)**

I love that they always have a selection of different roasts to try if you get a normal drip coffee (with a free refill, so you can try two different kinds). Also recently opened a location in Saint Elmo to fill the void that Plus Coffee left.

**[Mean Mug](http://meanmugcoffee.com)**

Mean Mug has never once disappointed me. They are a local favorite and the place that I've met others most frequently. It's far away enough from downtown that it's almost never been too busy for me to find a seat, and the atmosphere is perfect for casual conversations or getting stuff done. They recently opened a second location in North Shore, which captures a very similar vibe.

**[Velo Coffee Roasters](https://www.velocoffee.com)**

Provides that "hole-in-the-wall" experience: without the sign pointing to the roaster, you'd never know it was here, which I think really adds to the vibe. This place is a coffee nerd's dream. They have cuppings (coffee tastings), brewing gear for sale, and some of the most unique drink combinations in town. One of my favorites is a cold-brew drink that has hops and a scoop of ice cream (order the Bunny Hop). Their roasts are on fruitier side, which I actually really like.

**[Rembrandt’s](https://bluffviewartdistrictchattanooga.com/rembrandtscoffeehouse)**

This is probably my top recommendation for a coffee-house date. The location resembles a European style café and is in line with the rest of the art district's vibes. Their outdoor seating especially provides a lovely experience. The only problem with Rembrandt's is the busyness you'll probably encounter since it's in the heart of the tourist territory, but if you come on a weekday or less packed time you're sure to have a pleasant time.

**[Mad Priest Coffee Roasters](https://madpriestcoffee.com/)**

Note that this is a roaster's location and has almost no seating. Most of their coffee is more on the earthy/nutty side of flavors. RIP to their downtown cocktail joint — a terrible COVID casualty

**[Niedlov's](http://www.niedlovs.com)**

Niedlov's focus is on its baked goods and cafe more than coffee, but it's one of our go-to places for studying together. They use Velo's coffee and have such a good amount of seating that it's a safe bet for any time of the day. Free parking, as well, which is a plus that no one ever talks about but really is nice. The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is always great, and the food is delicious.


**[Frothy Monkey](https://frothymonkey.com/locations/southside-chattanooga/)**

Neat location next to the historic Chattanooga Choo Choo. I like their balcony setup a lot. They're open more than any other shop on this list.

**[Cadence Coffee Co.](https://www.cadencecoffeeco.com)**

Casual and comfortable hangout spot with lots of couches.

**[The Camp House](https://thecamphouse.com)**

Currently moving to a new location. TBD.

**[The Hot Chocolatier](https://thehotchocolatier.com)**

Chocolate and sweets shop with some delicious drinks.

**[Milk & Honey](https://milkandhoneychattanooga.com)**

This place is known for their homemade gelato, but they have a good coffee assortment as well.

**[Stone Cup Cafe](http://stonecupcafe.com/)**
	
“Black as Hell, Strong as Death, Sweet as Love.” 

Need I say more? Really cool building in North Shore, outdoor seating.
