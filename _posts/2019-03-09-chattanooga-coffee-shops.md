I've been living in the Chattanooga area to go to school for nearly four years, now, and I'm intending on staying for much longer to start working full-time doing software development and help out at my [church](https://crbchattanooga.org). One of my favorite parts of living in this city has been trying out the many local coffee shops. They serve many purposes in my life: for studying, for dates, for meetings, and even for local events. Some locations excel in one specific area, which makes for great diversity. Here are some of my top shops, in no particular order.

- **[Goodman Coffee Roasters](https://www.goodmancoffeeroasters.com)**

	This is a newer location but headed up by a master roaster Ian Goodman, founder of Greyfriar’s Coffee and Tea back in 1995 (which I sadly still have not been to). It's located in the Warehouse Row district, close to the downtown area. I love that they always have a selection of different roasts to try if you get a normal drip coffee (with a free refill, so you can try two different kinds). My wife loved their caramel sauce she put in her cappuccino (even though she typically prefers it without anything added). I highly recommend Goodman's for its cozy atmosphere and excellent coffee.

- **[Mean Mug](http://meanmugcoffee.com)**

	Mean Mug has never once disappointed me. They are a local favorite and the place that I've met others most frequently. It's far away enough from downtown that it's almost never been too busy for me to find a seat, and the atmosphere is perfect for casual conversations or getting stuff done. It used to get its coffee from Velo Roasters but recently has moved to roast their own. I really enjoy the decor in the place as well. They recently opened a second location in North Shore, which captures a very similar vibe. Mean Mug is the platonic ideal of a locally-owned coffee shop.

- **[Velo Coffee Roasters](https://www.velocoffee.com)**

	Velo is probably my favorite location on this list if for nothing else it literally provides that "hole-in-the-wall" experience. Walking into the roaster takes you through a brick-wall archway to a nice little garden area, through which you can enter through a side door. Without the sign pointing to the roaster, you'd never know it was here, which I think really adds to the charm. This place is a coffee nerd's dream. They have cuppings (coffee tastings), brewing gear for sale, and some of the most unique drink combinations in town. One of my favorites is a cold-brew drink that has hops and a scoop of ice cream (order the Bunny Hop). Velo is truly unique and delicious.

-  **[Rembrandt’s](https://bluffviewartdistrictchattanooga.com/rembrandtscoffeehouse)**

	This is probably my top recommendation for a coffee-house date. The location resembles a European style café and is in line with the rest of the art district's vibes. Sophie and I went here the night after I proposed for a late-night tea. Their outdoor seating especially provides a lovely experience. The only problem with Rembrandt's is the busyness you'll probably encounter since it's in the heart of the tourist territory, but if you come on a weekday or less packed time you're sure to have a pleasant time.

- **[The Mad Priest](https://www.madpriestcha.com)**

	I've only been here once, but I'm glad to see the recent opening of Mad Priest's full location since their roaster's location has almost no seating. Mad Priest is really emphasizing the role that coffee shops have in connecting people and impacting the community. Their roaster location has hired displaced refugees from Chattanooga and is still working to educate those in the local community in the art of coffee roasting, brewing, and tasting. Their new location has scheduled community events that I'm hoping to check out, including live music, and chess nights. I haven't even talked about their coffee, but I can see The Mad Priest becoming a Chattanooga favorite for years to come.

- **[Niedlov's](http://www.niedlovs.com)**

	Niedlov's focus is on its baked goods and cafe more than coffee, but it's one of our go-to places for studying together. They use Velo's coffee and have such a good amount of seating that it's a safe bet for any time of the day. Free parking, as well, which is a plus that no one ever talks about but really is nice. The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is always great, and the food is delicious. I definitely recommend Niedlov's to anyone as a purely Chattanoogan location.


Here's a fly-by list of other places to check out that I haven't visited quite as much:

*	[Plus Coffee](http://www.pluscoffee.co/stelmo): Nice little place in St. Elmo. Good for studying, but can be hard to have a conversation sometimes.
* [Frothy Monkey](https://frothymonkey.com/locations/southside-chattanooga/): Neat location next to the historic Chattanooga Choo Choo. I like their balcony setup a lot.
* [Cadence Coffee Co.](https://www.cadencecoffeeco.com): Casual and comfortable hangout spot with lots of couches.
* [The Camp House](https://thecamphouse.com): Really neat vibe at the place, and a lot of community events happening regularly. Plenty of good-sized tables and seating.
* [The Hot Chocolatier](https://thehotchocolatier.com): Chocolate shop with a cute setup and some delicious drinks.
* [Milk & Honey](https://milkandhoneychattanooga.com): This place is known for their homemade gelato, but they have a good coffee assortment as well.

One might ask why I would go to the trouble to visit so many various coffee shops. Each place has its own unique atmosphere, emphases, and strengths. I think Chattanooga is great partly because it brings in such a diverse and vibrant community, and the coffee shop scene is representative of that.

I'll try to keep this post updated as I try new places and have more to say about them. Thanks for reading!
