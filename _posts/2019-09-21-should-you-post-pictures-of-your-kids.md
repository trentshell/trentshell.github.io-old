I think nearly everyone has somewhat embarrassing pictures of themselves from their childhood. This didn't use to be such a pressing issue, but in our digital age with many parents broadcasting (sometimes not-so-flattering) images of their children for the world to see, it seems worthwhile to stop and consider the ramifications.

Legally speaking, in the U.S. it seems that if you lawfully took a photo, [
you also maintain all rights to publish (i.e. post) that image](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30765/is-it-illegal-to-post-a-picture-of-someone-without-their-permission/30767#30767). While it may be legal, this right to utilize photos can (and often is) used without much discernment. Of course many parents have completely good intentions to bring joy to others by sharing parts of their family's life. The underlying temptation, on the other hand, is to trade their children's privacy away for the dopamine rush of likes and comments. [Read this example](https://www.fastcompany.com/90315706/kids-parents-social-media-sharing), where a 14-year-old joins Facebook to discover that her entire "private" life had been documented and broadcasted, and will now follow her for the rest of her online life.

So here's the question to consider: Should children have a [reasonable expectation of privacy](https://www.findlaw.com/injury/torts-and-personal-injuries/what-is-the--reasonable-expectation-of-privacy--.html?fbclid=IwAR0yuwC3Pm71keVoljlI9YJTBMbYICc-gIYc0huD36H9pzcY6_q7bxk1xdQ) within the home? This has meaningful implications because it determines whether parents truly have a legal right to take and, by extension, post pictures of their children without their informed consent.
