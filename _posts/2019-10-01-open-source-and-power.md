[I highly recommend this episode of the podcast Rework.](https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-and-power-with-matt-mullenweg/) It features a discussion between [Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt) (developer of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org)) and [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk) (creator of the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) framework). Both are influential voices in the open source development world, but have differing opinions on power dynamics in centralized companies. It's worth a listen if you're interested in issues related to the economy of the internet and open source software.
