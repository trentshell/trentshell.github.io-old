In his most recent article for Circe Institute, Joshua Gibbs highlights an excellent point on teaching Western literature that resonates with my own experience.

> I cannot imagine a classical school where classical books are not taught, but there are simply so many great books in the Western canon that they all cannot be read. The fear of leaving someone or something out sadly prompts many classical schools to veer off into a survey approach, where little bits and pieces of many classics are read, but none in full.

At my alma mater (a Christian 4-year liberal arts college), all students are required to take two semesters of a class entitled "Cultural Heritage of the West," or "CHOW" for short. This class was essentially a crash-course in the major developments in Western culture from Gilgamesh all the way up to Marx. Most of the reading material from this class was exactly in the manner that Mr. Gibbs describes here: A short excerpt from every major work of each time period, and sometimes up to two or three assigned authors before each lecture.

Reflecting back on my time at Covenant, I think that this approach to teaching the classics has several downsides that were not immediately obvious. First of all, I think it removes the possibility to truly and honestly struggle through any significant part of the Western canon. No one I ever talked to in my class was truly worried about deeply wrestling with the ideas presented by any of the authors throughout the course. How could they when there was always another reading due in two days?

Furthermore, I have the feeling that a lot of students leaving these classes will feel they've gotten a grasp on the history of western culture when, in reality, they've only skimmed the surface of the names and major highlights. They graduate thinking that they understand Plato because they had to read a chapter of the Republic and have been introduced to the cave. I know that I felt this way.

This is not an unforeseen outcome by the Covenant faculty. CHOW is, by design, a brief survey of the things we Westerners take for granted. It very deliberately trades depth for breadth. I'm not necessarily saying that this approach was wrong, and I absolutely enjoyed taking these classes with the professors that I did. Looking back, though, I'm not convinced that it will leave a lasting impact on very many students.
