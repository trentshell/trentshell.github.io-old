Finished "[The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/)" on Netflix the other night. A few thoughts:

It's a documentary/drama on the individual and societal effects of social media companies. While there isn't much new for anyone who's kept up with this stuff for the past decade, I think it does do a good job of explaining machine learning and model building that companies do in a way that most people can probably understand.

There's a pretty extensive subplot that attempt to dramatically illustrate the ideas that come up, but I think it's a little hokey and detracts from the overall piece. I also think that the ending gets a bit preachy and heavy-handed (i.e. "if the government doesn't regulate these companies more the species is doomed").

The most interesting part to me was the interviews of fairly major people that have previously worked for Facebook/Twitter/Google and share their personal experiences falling prey to their own machinations.

Finally, I couldn't help but notice the fact that Netflix is glaringly absent, while they absolutely deserve to be in the spotlight for their own UX dark patterns. I guess biting the hand that feeds you is probably a bad idea.
