> Blocking cookies is bad for privacy. That’s the new disingenuous argument from Google, trying to justify why Chrome is so far behind Safari and Firefox in offering privacy protections. As researchers who have spent over a decade studying web tracking and online advertising, we want to set the record straight. Our high-level points are: 1) Cookie blocking does not undermine web privacy. Google’s claim to the contrary is privacy gaslighting. 2) There is little trustworthy evidence on the comparative value of tracking-based advertising. 3) Google has not devised an innovative way to balance privacy and advertising; it is latching onto prior approaches that it previously disclaimed as impractical. 4) Google is attempting a punt to the web standardization process, which will at best result in years of delay.

Here is a clearly-argued takedown of Google's position on web-tracking in Chrome. I think that it really highlights a key point that Google seems to either be missing or, perhaps, intentionally misconstruing: whether privacy is the same as confidentiality.

To Google, user privacy is attained if the relevant data never leaves Google's domain. The article's authors point this out as well:

> We are also disappointed that the announcement implicitly defines privacy as confidentiality. It ignores that, for some users, [**the privacy concern is behavioral ad targeting**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3306006)—not the web tracking that enables it. If an ad uses deeply personal information to appeal to emotional vulnerabilities or exploits psychological tendencies to generate a purchase, then that is a form of privacy violation—regardless of the technical details.

**Confidentiality** is the state of information being kept private and secure. **Privacy** is the state of information being observed by third parties.

Promoting confidentiality as privacy begs the question of whether that data should be collected in the first place. Continuing this kind of rhetoric is dangerous because it redefines what the right to privacy fundamentally means.
